## Overview

This project is a solution to the "Product Preview Card" challenge on Frontend Mentor. Frontend Mentor provides a platform for developers to enhance their coding skills by working on real-world projects. The goal of this project was to create a responsive product preview card using HTML and CSS.

## My Process

I started by carefully analyzing the Figma design provided in the challenge to understand the project requirements. Once I had a clear understanding of the design, I began by structuring my HTML markup following best practices for semantic HTML5.

I then applied custom CSS to style the card, making it visually appealing and responsive. Flexbox and media queries were used to ensure that the card layout adjusted smoothly to different screen sizes, making it look great on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media queries

## What I Learned

This project served as a great refresher for my frontend development skills. It allowed me to revisit and apply the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. Additionally, I gained experience in creating responsive web designs and using media queries to optimize layouts for various screen sizes.
